You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/sean-labouff/project-page/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### sc-ICEA novel immunoassay technology (future published research)
· Immerses students in both rehearsed and novel research investigations involving spectrophotometry and fluorescence microscopy

· Group project encourages students to design bioMEMS sensor based on immunoprecipitated assay technology



### DIY breadboard EEG (electroencephalogram)
(EKG for the brain)

· Students design a breadboard biomedical sensor with a DIY budget 

· Class introduces principles of digital signal processing and medical device design


### Novel experiment demonstrating efficacy of muscle growth inhibition
· Studied actin’s role in C2C12 myoblast fusion using time-lapse microscopy and fluorescent-transfected lines  

· Used standard primary/secondary antibody and blocking for additional immunofluorescent visualization 

· Introduces students to basics of tissue engineering/mammalian cell culture including western blot protein quantification protocol, RT-qPCR protocol, and sterile technique 



### Postulated microfluidic device for neuron culture and possible brain-machine interface
· Introduces students to protocol for microfluidic device fabrication, as well as associated physics 

· Group project encourages students to apply knowledge of fabrication protocol to design bioMEMS device 



### COMSOL simulation of botox delivery as mass transport system
· Investigated novel therapy for cerebral palsy using controlled hydrogel release of botulinum toxin (botox) 

· Students simulate diffusion and advection to characterize flow profiles in COMSOL multiphysics
